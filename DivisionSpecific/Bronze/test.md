# Bronze

All questions about the format of USACO contests should be answered by the USACO website. You may want to explore the [USACO Training Pages](http://train.usaco.org/), although the problems are fairly outdated and the difficulty curve is pretty steep if you're just starting. Bronze contests usually just involve "algorithmic thinking." :D 

Please refer to the [competitive programming handbook (CPH)](https://cses.fi/book.pdf).
